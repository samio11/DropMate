Parcel Management System
An efficient MERN stack-based Parcel Management System where users can book parcels, admins assign delivery personnel, and delivery persons deliver parcels.

Key Features
User Roles: Three types of usersâ€”User, Delivery Men, and Admin. Each has access to different features and dashboards.
Responsive Design: The application is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, ensuring seamless user experience across all platforms.
Secure Authentication: Implements email/password login with the ability to register users. Social login (Google) is available. Admin users are assigned manually via the database.
Parcel Booking: Users can book parcels by providing recipient details and parcel information. Parcel cost is calculated dynamically based on weight.
Dashboard Views:
Users: Book a Parcel, View Bookings, Update Profile
Delivery Men: View Assigned Parcels, Manage Deliveries, View Reviews
Admin: Manage Parcels, Assign Delivery Personnel, View Statistics
Admin Controls: Admin can manage all bookings, assign delivery personnel, and oversee users and delivery men, including promoting users to delivery men or admins.
Real-time Data with TanStack Query: Efficient data fetching using TanStack Query for enhanced performance.
Notifications & Alerts: Users receive sweet alerts/toasts for successful actions like CRUD operations and authentication.
Interactive Stats: Displays statistics like total parcels booked, total deliveries, and number of registered users using react-countup for animated numbers.
Top Delivery Men Section: Highlights the best-performing delivery men based on ratings and parcel deliveries.
Map Integration: Delivery men can view parcel locations using a map (Mapbox or React Leaflet) for easier navigation.
Payment Integration: Users can pay for deliveries using Stripe, with confetti animation upon successful payment.
JWT Authentication: Protects private routes and ensures secure access across sessions without requiring a re-login.
